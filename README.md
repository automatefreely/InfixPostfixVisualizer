# InfixPostfixVisualizer
You can view the visualizer here -> https://automatefreely.github.io/InfixPostfixVisualizer/ 

This project has two part
1. Auto Visualizer : This will automatically Convert the Infix To POstfix visually from where the user left (If the user left in an incorrect state then it will move base to the previous correct step and proceed).
2. Manual User Intraction : This will allow user to intract with the visualizer.

What has been done?
1. Auto Visualizer is in main.js and is solving the expression only from the first state (in which no user intraction has occured).
2. Manual User Intraction is in main2.js and is working nearly perfectly.

The task left is to join the two prefectly such that they intract flawlessly easily.
